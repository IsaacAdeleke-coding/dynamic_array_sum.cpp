# Dynamic Array Sum

This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates dynamic memory allocation for an array of integers. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the array, then takes input for each element, calculates the sum of the array, and prints the result.

## Features:
- Dynamically allocates memory for an array of integers based on user input.
- Fills the array with integers provided by the user.
- Calculates and prints the sum of the integers in the array.
- Frees dynamically allocated memory after use.

## Usage:
1. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    g++ -o dynamic_array_sum dynamic_array_sum.cpp
    ```

2. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./dynamic_array_sum
    ```

3. Input the number of elements and the integers when prompted.
